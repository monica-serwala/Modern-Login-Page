🧾 Project Title
Modern Login and Registration Interface with Toggle Animation

📝 Description
This project is a fully responsive and modern login/registration web interface designed using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It provides a smooth and visually appealing user experience with animated transitions, a dual-form layout, and social media login buttons.

The login page is not just functional but also aesthetically aligned with modern web design principles. It serves as a frontend interface and can be easily integrated with backend services to perform user authentication.

🎯 Objective
To create a visually attractive and user-friendly login interface that supports:

Both Sign In and Sign Up functionalities

Smooth transitions and animations using CSS3

Enhanced user interaction using JavaScript

Responsive design that works well on desktops and tablets

Placeholder social login buttons for integration with OAuth providers

🧪 Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structuring the forms and layout
CSS3	Styling the layout, buttons, inputs, and handling transitions
JavaScript	Managing the interactive toggle between login and registration
Font Awesome	Providing branded icons for social logins (Google, Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn)

🧑‍💼 User Interface Overview
The layout is built using three major sections inside a container:

Sign Up Form (.sign-up)

Inputs: Name, Email, Password

Social login icons

Register button

Descriptive text inviting users to register

Sign In Form (.sign-in)

Inputs: Email, Password

Social login icons

Password recovery link

Login button

Toggle Container (.toggle-container)

Contains two panels:

toggle-left: Shown when signing in

toggle-right: Shown when registering

Provides contextual messaging and buttons to toggle between the two states.

⚙️ How It Works
🔁 Form Switching Logic
The toggle is handled by adding/removing the active class to the main .container.

The JavaScript controls this behavior using addEventListener.

JavaScript Snippet:

js
Copy
Edit
const container = document.getElementById('container');
const registerBtn = document.getElementById('register');
const loginBtn = document.getElementById('login');

registerBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    container.classList.add("active");
});

loginBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    container.classList.remove("active");
});
When the active class is added, the .sign-in form slides out, and the .sign-up form slides in with a fade effect controlled via CSS keyframes.

🎨 Styling and Layout
The background uses a gradient that transitions from light gray to soft purple.

The form containers are rounded with box shadows to give a card-like appearance.

Each form is centered using flexbox and has consistent padding, margins, and rounded input fields.

Buttons are styled with uppercase text, gradient backgrounds, and hover transitions.

💬 Social Icons
Each form contains clickable icons meant to represent:

Google+

Facebook

GitHub

LinkedIn

These are placeholders and can be connected to real OAuth providers.

📱 Responsiveness
While the layout is optimized for desktop viewports, the CSS ensures it scales well on tablets. For mobile responsiveness, media queries can be added to stack forms vertically and reduce button/input sizes.

🚀 How to Use
Download or clone the repository.

Open the index.html file in any modern browser.

Click Sign Up to switch to the registration form.

Click Sign In to return to the login form.

Customize or connect it to your backend as needed.

🧩 Possible Improvements
Here are some suggestions to enhance functionality:

✅ Add form validation using JavaScript or HTML5 patterns

✅ Connect with Firebase/Auth0 for social login support

✅ Add error messages and success feedback

✅ Implement dark mode using CSS variables

✅ Improve mobile responsiveness with media queries

✅ Add animations on field focus and input validation
